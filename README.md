# battleship-react-go

A simple version of the game Battleship in React with a Go backend. Game logic is implemented on the Go side and React queries it by http api.

Only one ship per player to keep it simple.

TODO:
* place ships in React
* endpoint for ship placement
* implement shot logic on server
* game win logic
* GraphQL for api
* Postgres for state
